    "### Sets and their elements\n",
    "Basic notion in set theory is a <span style='color:blue'>*set*</span>. A set is a collections of <span style='color:blue'>*elements*</span>. We say that *$a$ is an element of set $A$* or *$a$ is not an element of set $A$*, and we write it as $a\\in A$ and $a\\not\\in A$, respectively. A given set can be for example described by listing all its elements, in this case we use the curly brackets to write $A=\\{a,b,c,d\\}$. Alternatively, we can define sets by specifying the properties of its elements, for example $B=\\{x:x\\mbox{ is an even number}\\}$. There are some commonly used sets for which we use specific symbols, for example:\n",
    "- $\\mathbb{N}=\\{1,2,\\ldots\\}$ - the set of all natural numbers \n",
    "- $\\mathbb{Z}=\\{\\ldots,-2,-1,0,1,2,\\ldots\\}$ - the set of all integers\n",
    "- $\\mathbb{Q}=\\{\\frac{p}{q}:p,q\\in\\mathbb{Z} \\wedge q\\neq 0\\}$ - the set of all fractions\n",
    "- $\\mathbb{R}$ - the set of all real numbers\n",
    "- $\\mathbb{C}$ - the set of all complex numbers\n",
    "\n",
    "Two sets $A$ and $B$ are <span style='color:blue'>*equal*</span> if and only if they have the same elements, i.e.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\boxed{A=B\\Leftrightarrow \\forall_{x} \\,(x\\in A\\Leftrightarrow x\\in B)}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "> The sets $\\{2,5,9,3,5\\}$ and $\\{3,9,5,2\\}$ are equal.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Subsets\n",
    "\n",
    "If $A$ and $B$ are sets and\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\boxed{\\forall_x \\,(x\\in A\\Rightarrow x\\in B)}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "then $A$ is called a <span style='color:blue'>*subset*</span> of $B$ and denote it by $A\\subseteq B$. In other words, $A$ is a subset of $B$ if all elements of set $A$ are also elements of set $B$. It is always true that $A\\subseteq A$. In the case when $A\\subseteq B$ and there exist element of set $B$ that are not elements of set $A$, then we call set $A$ a proper subset of $B$ and denote it by $A\\subset B$. \n",
    "\n",
    "***Add picture of a subset***\n",
    "\n",
    "> Let $A=\\{2,4,6,8\\}$ and $B=\\{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10\\}$. Then $A\\subset B$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Empty set\n",
    "\n",
    "The set that does not contain any elements is called the <span style='color:blue'>*empty set*</span> and it is usually denoted by $\\emptyset$.\n",
    "> The set $\\{x\\in \\mathbb{R}:x^2=-1\\}$ is empty since there is no real number that when squared gives $-1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "> The empty set is a subset of any other set. In other words, for any set $A$, we can write $\\emptyset \\in A$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Equal sets\n",
    "\n",
    "Two sets are equal if the first one is a subset of the second one and vice versa:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Power set\n",
    "\n",
    "The set containing as elements all subsets of a given set $A$ is called the <span style='color:blue'>*power set*</span> of $A$ and is denoted by $\\mathcal{P}(A)$, i.e $\\mathcal{P}(A)=\\{B:B\\subseteq A\\}$.\n",
    "> The power set of $A=\\{a,1,\\square\\}$ is\n",

    "\n",
    "- If the set $A$ has $n$ elements, then its power set $\\mathcal{P}(A)$ has $2^n$ elements.\n",
    "- For any set $A$ it is always true that $\\emptyset\\in \\mathcal{P}(A)$.\n",

    "\n",
    "The number of elements of a finite set $A$ (a set with finite number of elements) is called its <span style='color:blue'>*cardinality*</span>, and is denoted by $|A|$. "
